# Project 3C: Data Warehouse & Cloud Integration

This project automates ingestion and transformation of structured data from CSV sources (hosted on S3 or locally) into a **Snowflake data warehouse**. It uses **Apache Airflow** for orchestration, **dbt** for transformation and testing, and **Python** for supporting ETL utilities. The pipeline is modular, secure, and aligned with modern Data Engineering practices.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11** – Core scripting and ETL support  
- **Apache Airflow (2.8.1)** – Orchestration  
- **Snowflake** – Cloud data warehouse  
- **dbt Core** – SQL-based transformations and testing  
- **AWS S3** – Cloud object storage (planned integration)  
- **Git + Jira** – Version control and task tracking  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Ingest structured data from AWS S3 or local storage
- ✅ Load into Snowflake using native connectors (`COPY INTO`, dbt sources)
- ✅ Transform data via dbt models (staging → core → final)
- ✅ Orchestrate the full workflow using Apache Airflow
- ✅ Validate transformations via dbt tests and unit tests
- ✅ Secure secrets via `.env`, following production patterns
- ✅ Maintain clean, modular, job-ready Git repo and documentation

---

## 🔐 Secrets Management

Secrets are stored locally in a `.env` file and are **excluded from Git** using `.gitignore`. These include:

- Snowflake credentials (account, user, password, warehouse, schema)
- AWS credentials (for S3 integration — optional)
- dbt profile targets

✅ For production, secrets should be managed via **AWS Secrets Manager** or **Vault**.

## 🖼️ Visuals & Documentation

All visuals, diagrams, and outputs are stored in:

- `diagrams/` – Pipeline architecture and dbt lineage screenshots
- `docs/screenshots/` – Airflow UI, test results, CLI logs, and deliverables
- `docs/jira_sync_log.md` – Git ↔ Jira sync entries
- `developer_notes.md` – Lessons, blockers, and implementation notes
